As I was searching for ways to create my own resume website, I found that most of the options available were pretty dull and didn't inspire me. I really wanted to create something that showed off my personality and style, but I wasn't sure how to do that. That's when I came across some cool old-school internet websites, and I realized that was the way to go. With this site I used React and Next.js to create something that shows who I really am and as a way to comment on what the internet has become. Link to the site is on the github page
